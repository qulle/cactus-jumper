# Jumping Game in Java
### A game i did during my first year at the University 

## About
The game was created back in 2017 and was developed in Eclipse Oxygen. I thought it would be of more use in my University era projects here on GitHub than collecting bit-dust on some harddrive of mine.

## Java version
The Java version i used to compile this game was.
```
$ javac -version
javac 9.0.4

$ java -version
java 9.0.4
```
## Compiling
Both of the commands must be run from the src directory.

Compile the game. 
```
$ javac -d ../bin ./game/Jumper.java
```

Copy the images directory to the bin directory.
```
$ cp ./images/ ../bin/ -r
```

## Running
Run the program. Must be ran from the bin directory.
```
$ java ./game/Jumper
```

**Note** that you can't append .class to the Jumper-file when executing the game.
